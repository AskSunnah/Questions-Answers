  <h1>Participating in Bank Promotions and Interest-Based Offers</h1>

  <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> I recently opened a student checking account with an American Bank for a debit card. 
  After completing 10 qualifying transactions (worth $100), they offer a one-time $100 promotional bonus/gift for opening an account with them.  
  Is it halal to use the money acquired from this?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

  <p>In the name of Allah, all praise is due to Allah, and may Peace and Blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <p>This is not permissible, because by accepting such an offer, you are participating in a promotion that encourages others to open an account with a specific bank. As is well known, most banks in non-Muslim countries operate based on <em>riba</em> (interest).</p>

  <h2>From the Qur’an:</h2>

  <blockquote>
    “…and do not help one another in sin and transgression. Fear Allah. Surely Allah is severe in retribution.”<br>
    <strong>[Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:2]</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Engaging in such promotional offers can be seen as a form of indirect advertisement for the bank. Since conventional banks are founded upon interest-based systems - which are clearly prohibited in Islam - it is not permissible to promote or encourage interactions with such institutions.</p>
