  <h1>Singing Without Musical Instruments in Islam</h1>

  <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Can I use famous songs without instruments(the original song contains instruments but I have a ‘vocals only’ version), for my advertisements.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
  
    <p>In the name of Allah, all praise is due to Allah, and may Peace and Blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <p>
    Singing without musical instruments is divided into two types in Islam: a permissible type and a forbidden type.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the content of the singing includes prohibited matters — such as speaking about immoral acts, glorifying alcohol, calling to polytheism, or promoting religious innovations — then it is strictly forbidden, whether or not musical instruments are used.
  </p>

  <p><strong>The Prophet ﷺ said:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    "Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him speak good or remain silent."<br>
    (Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Also, using singing as a means of earning income must be approached with caution. If it leads to falling into doubtful or prohibited matters, then it is better to leave it.
  </p>

  <p><strong>The Prophet ﷺ said:</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    "...Whoever avoids doubtful matters has protected his religion and his honor."<br>
    (Reported by Muslim)
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    However, if the singing is free from all prohibited content, and it consists only of poetry or meaningful words without music, then it is not considered forbidden in itself, as it falls under the category of eloquent or elevated speech.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nevertheless, it is not appropriate for a Muslim to use such means to promote clips or content, especially when purer and more dignified ways of spreading goodness are available.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, we do not declare all singing without music to be forbidden, but we advise staying away from doubtful matters and turning to more suitable means for spreading knowledge and benefit. And Allah knows best.
