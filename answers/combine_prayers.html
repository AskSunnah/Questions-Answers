  <h1>Ruling On Combining Prayers Without a Reason?</h1>

  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it Allowed to combine Salatul Duhr and Asr without any reason?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the name of Allah, all praise is due to Allah, and may Peace and Blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <p>
    The origin is that, without a valid reason, it is not allowed to combine Duhr and Asr. A reason could be a traveler praying at home before traveling, or a resident who is sick. For example, if someone has a surgical procedure and the time of salah enters, they may combine. All of these and similar situations that prevent a person from praying on time are considered valid reasons.
  </p>

  <h2>Authentic Hadith:</h2>

  <blockquote>
    Ibn 'Abbas reported:  
    <br><br>
    "The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) observed the noon and afternoon prayers together in Medina without being in a state of fear or in a state of journey."  
    <br><br>
    (Abu Zubair said: I asked Sa'id [one of the narrators] why he did that. He said: I asked Ibn 'Abbas as you have asked me, and he replied that he [the Holy Prophet] wanted that no one among his Ummah should be put to [unnecessary] hardship.)  
    <br><br>
    (Sahih Muslim 705b)
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

  <p>
    The origin is that it is not allowed to combine Duhr and Asr without a valid reason. Valid reasons include situations such as a traveler praying before traveling, a resident who is sick, or someone undergoing a procedure when the time of salah enters. These and similar situations that prevent a person from praying on time are considered valid reasons. 
  </p>

  <p>
   The authentic hadith from Ibn 'Abbas, where the Prophet (ﷺ) combined prayers in Medina without fear or travel, serves as evidence for Ahlul Sunnah's stance: combining prayers is permitted only in cases of genuine hardship. Without a valid excuse or legitimate difficulty, combining prayers is not allowed.

  <p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>
