  <h1>Is Masturbation Haram?</h1>

  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is Masturbation from the major sins?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the name of Allah, all praise is due to Allah, and may Peace and Blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <p>
    Masturbation is impermissible, but it is not from the major sins. A person should not take this matter lightly. Allah says:
  </p>

  <h2>From the Qur’an:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Surah Al-Mu’minun, Ayah 5–7:</strong><br />
      <blockquote>
        “Those who guard their chastity. Except with their wives or those ˹bondwomen˺ in their possession, for then they are free from blame. But whoever seeks beyond that are the transgressors.”
      </blockquote>
      Allah addresses the believers and commands them to protect their private parts from impermissible acts. Then He clarifies: except with their wives or those bondwomen in their possession. Anyone who goes beyond these two has indeed transgressed the limits set by Allah.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Also, the four schools of Islamic jurisprudence regard this act as impermissible, as well as Ibn Taymiyyah, who stated that masturbation is prohibited (حرام) according to the majority of scholars. He considered this to be the more correct opinion within the Hanbali school of thought. That being said, masturbation is not from the major sins.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Surah An-Nur, Ayah 33:</strong><br />
      <blockquote>
        “And let those who do not have the means to marry keep themselves chaste until Allah enriches them out of His bounty.”
      </blockquote>
      It is upon the Muslim to strive to get married, as the Prophet ﷺ said:
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>From the Sunnah:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Sahih al-Bukhari 1806:</strong><br />
      <blockquote>
        “O young men, if you are able to support a wife, get married. Verily, it lowers the gaze and guards chastity. Whoever is not able to do so, he must fast as it will restrain his passions.”
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>Also, Allah says:</p>
  <h2>From the Qur’an:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Surah An-Nur, Ayah 30:</strong><br/>
      <blockquote>
        “O Prophet!˺ Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their chastity. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do.”
      </blockquote>
      A person should keep themselves chaste, lower their gaze, and try to get married. They should stay away from masturbation, and if they fall into it, they should repent immediately. However, one must not say to themselves, “Since masturbation is not a major sin, it's okay.” That is why some of the pious predecessors said:
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> This is why some of the pious predecessors said:</p> 
  <ul>
    <blockquote>
      “Do not look at the smallness of the sin but look at the One whom you have disobeyed.”
    </blockquote>
    Masturbation is a very filthy matter in Islam and is not suitable at all.
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>
    Masturbation is prohibited in Islam, though it is not from the major sins. A Muslim should strive to remain chaste, lower the gaze, and seek marriage. If one falls into it, they must repent immediately and not take the sin lightly, remembering that disobedience to Allah should never be considered minor.
  </p>

  <p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>
