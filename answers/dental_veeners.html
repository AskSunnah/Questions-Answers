  <h1>Are Dental Veneers Permissible in Islam?</h1>

  <p><strong>Questions:</strong> Salam Wu alaykum Wa rahmatullahi Wa barakatu, Are Veneers permitted in Islam?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the name of Allah, all praise is due to Allah, and may Peace and Blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <p>
    Veneers are permitted only in cases of necessity, meaning if someone cannot eat properly, experiences pain, or there is harm, then it is allowed. However, for someone who simply wants to beautify themselves, this is impermissible, as it falls under changing the creation of Allah. The origin is that anything which changes the creation of Allah from the whole body for beautification is not allowed. As for whitening, this is not considered changing the creation of Allah.
  </p>

  <h2>Authentic Hadith:</h2>

  <blockquote>
    “The Messenger of Allah cursed the woman who does tattoos and the one who has them done, and those who pluck their eyebrows and file their teeth for the purpose of beautification, and those who change the creation of Allah.”  
    <br><br>
    (Sunan Ibn Majah 1989)
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

  <p>
    Veneers are only allowed in Islam when there is a necessity, such as difficulty eating, pain, harm, or damaged teeth. If they are used only for beautification, they are not permitted, as this is considered changing the creation of Allah. The basic rule is that anything done purely to change the natural creation for beautification is forbidden. However, whitening is not considered changing Allah’s creation.

  <p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>
