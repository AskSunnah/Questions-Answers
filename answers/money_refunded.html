  <h1>Bank Refund Issue: Should I Keep the Money?</h1>

  <p><strong>Question:</strong> I ordered a device recently, and payment was successful. Now, a couple of months after I received the device, PayPal returned the money saying it was due to a security risk. It happened twice. In this scenario, should I keep the money?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. All praise is due to Allah, and may peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <p>
    If a payment made through the bank is refunded to you unintentionally, it is obligatory to ensure the rightful owner receives their due. If you are unable to complete the payment through the bank or any other method, you should contact the seller directly to inform them of the situation and seek guidance on how to proceed.
  </p>

  <h2>Fulfilling Rights:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Obligation to Return the Money:</strong><br>
      It is your responsibility to ensure that the seller receives their payment, even if the refund was not your fault.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Contact the Seller if Bank Transfer is Not Possible:</strong><br>
      If for any reason you cannot send the money back through the original payment method, reach out to the seller for instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Return the Item if Resolution is Not Possible:</strong><br>
      In cases where payment cannot be made and no resolution is found, it would be necessary to return the item.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Applicable to Both Muslims and Non-Muslims:</strong><br>
      Fulfilling the rights of others is obligatory, regardless of the seller's religion.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    Fulfilling the rights of others is an obligation upon every believer, irrespective of faith.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

  <p>
    In summary, if a bank refunds your money due to a security risk, you are still responsible for ensuring the seller is paid or the item is returned. This is an obligation to maintain justice and fairness.  
  </p>

  <p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>
