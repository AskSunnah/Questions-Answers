  <h1>Ruling on Rebelling Against Rulers in Democratic Countries</h1>

  <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the ruling on rebelling against the rulers of democratic countries? By rebelling, I mean demonstrations and sit-ins, and not rebellion with weapons.</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the name of Allah, all praise is due to Allah, and may Peace and Blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <p>
    If a ruler is a kafir, then khurooj (rebellion) could become obligatory if the proper conditions are met. These conditions include:
  </p>

  <h2>Conditions for Khurooj:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The ruler must actually be a kafir:</strong><br>
      For example, if he denies the obligations of Salah, Fasting, Zakah, and claims that these are lies in Islam.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Established proof must be made against him:</strong><br>
      Scholars must advise him, discuss with him, and make a sound judgment that he is indeed a kafir. It is not allowed for a normal layman to make takfeer on anyone.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Power must be available against the government:</strong><br>
      Governments possess power, wealth, and armies. If such capability is not present, it is not allowed to proceed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The benefit must outweigh the harm:</strong><br>
      For example, if millions of Muslims would die by going against the government, then it is not permissible.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A ready leader must be available from Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah:</strong><br>
      To be appointed after the removal of the government. Otherwise, there is no point in doing khurooj.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Important Notes:</h2>

  <p>
    It is important to note that khurooj is not the way of Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah, especially in recent times where people go out against governments, engaging in protests involving free-mixing between men and women, chanting, and sometimes even playing music. This is certainly not the Islamic way.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    Sadly, the Muslim community has adopted this idea from the West and imitated them.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

  <p>
    If the conditions mentioned above are fulfilled, then khurooj becomes obligatory upon the Muslims, not just merely allowed. However, if they are not met, then it is not permitted.  
  </p>

  <p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>
