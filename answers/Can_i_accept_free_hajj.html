  <h1>Ruling on Sponsored Hajj</h1>

  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you. Is it permissible to accept the performance of Hajj funded by a wealthy donor? Meaning, someone is willing to cover the costs of Hajj for anyone who wants to go. We are not in desperate need, but we would have to wait in order to save up for the Hajj expenses.</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the name of Allah, all praise is due to Allah, and may Peace and Blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <h2>From the Qur’an:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Surah Aal-Imran (3:97):</strong><br>
      <blockquote>
        “Pilgrimage to this House is an obligation by Allah upon whoever is able among the people.”
      </blockquote>
      Allah has made Hajj obligatory upon every Muslim who is an adult, sane, and able to do so. There is no issue with someone choosing to gift or donate money to help another person perform Hajj.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>From the Sunnah:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Sahih Muslim 2699:</strong><br>
      Abu Huraira reported:<br>
      <blockquote>
        “Allah helps the servant as long as he helps his brother.”
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sahih al-Bukhari 2442:</strong><br>
      Ibn Umar رضي الله عنهما reported:<br>
      <blockquote>
        “Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs.”
      </blockquote>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>In light of the clear guidance from the Qur'an and authentic hadiths, it is evident that accepting a gift or donation to perform Hajj is permissible, even for those who may eventually be able to afford it themselves. Islam encourages mutual support and generosity among Muslims, especially in matters of worship and obedience to Allah. However, the one offering such support should ensure they have first fulfilled their own obligation of Hajj.</p>

  <p><strong>And Allah knows best.</strong></p>
