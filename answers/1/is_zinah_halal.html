  <h1>Zinah (Fornication) in Islam</h1>

  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Is Zinah (Fornication) Halal in Islam?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Zinah (adultery or fornication) is strictly haram (forbidden) in Islam. It is classified as one of the major sins in both the Qur’an and the Sunnah.</p>

  <h2>From the Qur’an:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Surah Al-Furqan (25:68):</strong><br>
      <blockquote>
        “They are those who do not invoke any other god besides Allah, nor take a human life—made sacred by Allah—except with legal right, nor commit fornication. And whoever does any of this will face the penalty.”
      </blockquote>
      This verse includes fornication as one of the major sins, along with shirk and murder.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Surah Al-Furqan (25:69):</strong><br>
      <blockquote>
        “Their punishment will be multiplied on the Day of Judgment, and they will remain in it forever, in disgrace.”
      </blockquote>
      A severe warning of punishment and humiliation for those who commit such acts.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Surah Al-Isra (17:32):</strong><br>
      <blockquote>
        “Do not go near adultery. It is truly a shameful deed and an evil way.”
      </blockquote>
      Not only is adultery forbidden, but even going near it—such as through temptation or inappropriate interaction—is prohibited.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>From the Sunnah:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Sahih Muslim 1676a:</strong><br>
      Abdullah ibn Mas'ud reported the Prophet ﷺ said:<br>
      <blockquote>
        “It is not permissible to take the life of a Muslim except in one of three cases: the married adulterer, a life for a life, and the deserter of Islam.”
      </blockquote>
      A married person committing adultery is liable for capital punishment in Islamic law.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sahih al-Bukhari 6809:</strong><br>
      Ibn Abbas reported:<br>
      <blockquote>
        “The servant does not commit adultery while he is a believer...”
      </blockquote>
      Adultery contradicts true faith—at the moment of committing it, the person is not in a state of belief.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sunan Abi Dawud 4690:</strong><br>
      Abu Huraira reported:<br>
      <blockquote>
        “When a man commits adultery, faith departs from him as if it were a cloud overhead. When he stops, faith returns to him.”
      </blockquote>
      This hadith shows how grave the act is—it causes faith to temporarily leave the heart.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
  <p>
    Zinnah is a major sin that brings about spiritual, social, and legal consequences. Islam calls believers to purity, modesty, and safeguarding their chastity. May Allah protect us all from such sins and guide us to what is pure and lawful.
